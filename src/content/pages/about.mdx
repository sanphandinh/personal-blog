Hello, I’m San Phan, a passionate web developer with over 8 years of experience building high-quality websites and applications. I specialize in frontend development, with expertise in various technologies and frameworks. I believe productivity and quality are the most important to the engineer. So in my career, I always try to improve my skills and knowledge to make the best product that is of high quality and archived in the shortest time with the least effort.


## My Journey

My major at the university was not related to computers or programming. I was a student of control and automation engineering at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Before I graduated high school, I'd been very interested in computers and programming. And I decided to join the HUST. However, after that, I haven’t achieved the major that I want. I have to learn in the major that I don’t like. But I don’t give up on my dream. I learned programming by myself and joined a technical company after graduating from the university. And my career started here. Actually, when I started as a front-end developer, I didn’t have any experience with it, and I also very much hated the Javascript language. However, nowadays this is my favorite language, and I’m very happy to work with it.

## Professional Experience

With 8 years of experience, I worked with some companies and projects. Here are some of the key projects that I have worked on:

### Key Projects

1. [**Real estate Platform**](https://onehousing.vn): developed a scalable real estate platform with features such as secondary real estate trading, primary real estate trading, home valuation, real estate blog, etc…
2. [**UI builder tool**](https://onehousing.vn/danh-sach-uu-dai):  I developed a UI builder tool that allows my stakeholders (marketing) to quickly create a standalone landing page without any help from the developer. It’s based on ReactJS and the third-party [Plasmic](https://www.plasmic.app/)
3. [**Project cost**](https://project-cost.moneyforward.com/): Developed a financial solution for calculating every cost in one project. This solution is used by the Japanese company.
4. [**Common master**](https://project-cost.moneyforward.com): Actually, this is a common feature solution that is used for many web projects. It includes the department, project and trade-partner management. We used a micro-frontend architecture to build this solution. This is based on ReactJS and web-component

## Philosophy and Approach

I believe in the power of continuous learning and improvement. I always strive to learn new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.

## Personal Interests

I don’t have many more interests. So, outside of work, I enjoy building side projects and blogging about the latest in web development. In my free time, you can find me reading books and manga, watching movies (I love comedy and action films), or thinking about new project ideas.
